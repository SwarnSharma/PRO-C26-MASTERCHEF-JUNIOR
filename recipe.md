# Method:-

Step 1. Chop the potatoes.

To prepare this easy recipe, you have to first wash the potatoes, scrubbing them well, and dry completely.Peeling is optional cut the potatoes in the right shape and size.You can also use a fries cutter for that long, even shape.  If not, Cut each potato in half the long way, lay the cut side flat on the cutting surface, and cut into 1/2-inch to 1/4-inch slices. Stack these slices and cut them into the same width sticks to make matchstick fries. Repeat with the remaining potatoes.

Step 2. Soak the cutted potatoes in ice-cold water for 10-15 minutes.

Now,Put the cutted potatoes in a large bowl and cover it with icy cool water. Soak for at least 20 minutes or up to an hour. Keep them submerged in water or they will turn black. This step gets rid of excess starch, resulting in fluffier and crispier fries.

Step 3. Drain and Dry the Potatoes.

Drain the potatoes sticks and lay them dry with paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Arrange them in a single layer to air-dry for a bit. The drier they are before frying, is better.

Step 4. Fry the potatoes.

At this point, you can stash the fries in the fridge and finish frying them the next day. Let them warm up a bit before frying again.
